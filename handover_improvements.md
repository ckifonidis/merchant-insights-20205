Handover Document: Merchant Insights Dashboard Improvements
Overview
This document outlines the completed improvements and remaining tasks for the Merchant Insights Dashboard application. The work focused on enhancing chart functionality, improving user experience, and implementing consistent design patterns across the application.

Completed Work ‚úÖ
Step 1 - Timeline Filtering and Chart Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Line Chart Improvements: All line charts now use straight lines (type="linear") instead of curved lines
Timeline Filtering: Implemented proper timeline aggregation with correct date labels:
Monthly view shows "Apr 2025, May 2025" format
Yearly view shows "2025" format
Quarterly view shows "Q2 2025" format
Created timelineHelpers.js utility for consistent data processing
Greek Translation Fixes: Fixed gender translations from "ŒÜŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ"/"ŒìœÖŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ∫Œ±" to "ŒÜŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµœÇ"/"ŒìœÖŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ∫ŒµœÇ"
Chart Updates: Applied timeline filtering to TransactionsChart, RevenueChart, CustomersChart, RevenueTrendChart, and RevenueChangeChart
Step 2 - Dashboard Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Chart Tooltips: Updated format to "ŒàŒºœÄŒøœÅŒøœÇ: Value (+X% from last year)" with black font
Chart Titles: Removed "vs last year" from chart titles
Dashboard Metrics:
Reordered to totalRevenue, totalTransactions, avgTransaction
Created separate DashboardMetrics.jsx component with individual metric cards
CustomersChart: Changed legend from "Œ†ŒµŒªŒ¨œÑŒµœÇ" to "ŒàŒºœÄŒøœÅŒøœÇ"
Chart Ordering: Reordered to RevenueChart, TransactionsChart, CustomersChart
Step 3 - Revenue Tab Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Revenue Trend Tooltips: Updated to match dashboard format with black font
Chart Type Selection: Moved to upper right for RevenueByInterests and RevenueByChannel charts
RevenueByInterests: Fixed label overflow with better truncation and spacing
RevenueByChannel:
Fixed pie chart tooltips to show percentage values
Implemented consistent colors across chart types
Added common color legend
Go For More Metrics:
Displayed in horizontal layout (one line)
Removed "Œ±œÄœå Go For More" from metric titles
Created simplified GoForMoreMetricCard component
Revenue Metrics: Created RevenueMetrics.jsx with separate individual components
Step 4 - RevenueByChannel Chart Enhancements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Pie Chart Improvements:
Consistent Colors: Physical Store (#007B85) and E-commerce (#7BB3C0) across merchant and competition
Fixed Tooltips: Now properly displays "Physical Store: 65%" with actual percentage values
Simplified Labels: Pie slices show only percentages (e.g., "65%")
Common Color Legend: Shared legend below pie charts
Stacked Bar Implementation:
Replaced "Bars" with "Stacked Bar": Similar to CustomersByGender chart
Consistent Colors: Same color scheme as pie charts
Interactive Features: Hover tooltips and total revenue display
Detailed Legends: Shows percentages and currency values
Chart Type Selection: Moved to upper right with three options (Stacked Bar, Pie Charts, Table)
Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
Critical Issue - RevenueByChannel Pie Chart Responsiveness
Priority: HIGH

Issue: The pie chart layout has responsiveness problems that need to be addressed
Impact: Chart may not display properly on different screen sizes
Recommendation: This should be the first issue addressed in the next development cycle
Suggested Fix: Review the grid layout and ResponsiveContainer configuration for mobile and tablet viewports
Remaining Work üîÑ
Step 4 - Demographics Improvements (Not Started)
Based on the improvements.md file, the following Demographics tab improvements are pending:

Chart Type Selection: Move to upper right for all demographic charts
Age Group Charts: Implement consistent styling and tooltips
Gender Chart: Ensure consistency with other stacked bar implementations
Shopping Frequency: Apply consistent chart patterns
Demographics Metrics: Create separate metric components similar to Revenue tab
Step 5 - Competition Tab Improvements (Not Started)
Chart Consistency: Apply consistent chart patterns and colors
Tooltip Formatting: Ensure black font and consistent format
Metric Components: Create separate competition metric cards
Chart Type Selection: Move to upper right position
